to open a GitHub pull request (\"PR\"), there are a few guidelines of what we are looking for in patches. Make sure you go through this document and ensure that your code proposal is aligned.\nSign off your work\nThe sign-off is an added line at the end of the explanation for the commit, certifying that you wrote it or otherwise have the right to submit it as an open-source patch. By submitting a contribution, you agree to be bound by the terms of the DCO Version 1.1 and Apache-2.0 License.\nSigning off a commit certifies the below Developer's Certificate of Origin (DCO):\nDeveloper's Certificate of Origin 1.1\n\nBy making a contribution to this project, I certify that:\n\n   (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I\n       have the right to submit it under the open source license\n       indicated in the file; or\n\n   (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best\n       of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source\n       license and I have the right under that license to submit that\n       work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part\n       by me, under the same open source license (unless I am\n       permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated\n       in the file; or\n\n   (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other\n       person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified\n       it.\n\n   (d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution\n       are public and that a record of the contribution (including all\n       personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is\n       maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with\n       this project or the open source license(s) involved.All contributions to this project are licensed under the Apache-2.0.\nWhen committing your change, you can add the required line manually so that it looks like this:\nSigned-off-by: John Doe Alternatively, configure your Git client with your name and email to use the -s flag when creating a commit:\n$ git config --global user.name \"John Doe\"\n$ git config --global user.email \"john.doe@example.com\"Creating a signed-off commit is then possible with -s or --signoff:\n$ git commit -s -m \"this is a commit message\"To double-check if the commit was signed-off, look at the log output:\n$ git log -1\ncommit 37ceh170e4hb283bb73d958f2036ee5k07e7fde7 (HEAD -> issue-35, origin/main, main)\nAuthor: John Doe \nDate:   Mon Aug 1 11:27:13 2020 -0400\n\n    this is a commit message\n\n    Signed-off-by: John Doe Sign your commits\nTo ensure the authenticity and integrity of code contributions, we require that all commits are signed. Signing commits proves that your commits were truly created by you, as the holder of a private key.\nConfiguring git to sign your commits is a straightforward process. To get set up, see GitHub's documentation on signing commits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"dependencies.html":{"url":"dependencies.html","title":"package-dependencies - dependencies","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Dependencies\n    \n    \n        \n            @angular/animations : ^15.2.0\n        \n            @angular/common : ^15.2.0\n        \n            @angular/compiler : ^15.2.0\n        \n            @angular/core : ^15.2.0\n        \n            @angular/forms : ^15.2.0\n        \n            @angular/platform-browser : ^15.2.0\n        \n            @angular/platform-browser-dynamic : ^15.2.0\n        \n            @angular/router : ^15.2.0\n        \n            rxjs : ~7.8.0\n        \n            tslib : ^2.3.0\n        \n            zone.js : ~0.12.0\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"index.html":{"url":"index.html","title":"getting-started - index","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n\n\n    \n        BackNG\n    \n    \n        Dynamic back navigation supporting web history within angular\n    \n    Report Bug\n    ·\n    Request Feature\n\n\n\nAbout The Project\nThis was born out of the desire to have a robust utility that handles the back navigation within angular applications.\n(back to top)\n\n\n\nRoadmap\nSee the open issues for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).\n(back to top)\n\n\nCode of Conduct\nSee CODE_OF_CONDUCT for more information.\n(back to top)\n\n\nContributing\nSee CONTRIBUTING for more information.\n(back to top)\n\n\nLicense\nDistributed under the Apache-2.0 License.
